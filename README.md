Rare Disease Classification Using Synthetic Data
This repository contains the code and final report for my Master’s Research Project (MRP), focused on improving rare disease classification using synthetic data augmentation techniques.

Project Overview
In real-world healthcare datasets, class imbalance—especially for rare diseases—can severely hinder model performance. This project explores the use of Gaussian Copula-based synthetic data generation to augment the minority class, aiming to improve classification accuracy while considering privacy and ethical concerns.

Key Components

Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and standardized real-world binary classification health data

Synthetic Data Generation: Augmented the minority class using Gaussian Copula models

Model Training & Evaluation: Evaluated performance of Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and CatBoost

Privacy & Ethics Discussion: A detailed review of synthetic data privacy in the medical domain

Future Work: Explored potential use of Domain-Adversarial Neural Networks (DANN) and deeper model behavior analysis

The final academic report is available in the /report folder, and all implementation code is provided in /code.

This work was completed as part of my Master's in Data Science at Toronto Metropolitan University
